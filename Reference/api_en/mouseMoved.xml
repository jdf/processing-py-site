<description><![CDATA[
The <b>mouseMoved()</b> function is called every time the mouse moves and a mouse button is not pressed. (If a button <i>is</i> being pressed, <b>mouseDragged()</b> is called instead.)
<br/><br/>
Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
