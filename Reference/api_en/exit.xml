Quits/stops/exits the program. Programs without a <b>draw()</b> function exit automatically after the last line has run, but programs with <b>draw()</b> run continuously until the program is manually stopped or <b>exit()</b> is run.<br />
<br />
Rather than terminating immediately, <b>exit()</b> will cause the sketch to exit after <b>draw()</b> has completed (or after <b>setup()</b> completes if called during the <b>setup()</b> function).<br />
