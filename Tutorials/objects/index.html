  <h3>I'm Down with OOP</h3>Before we begin examining the details
  of how object-oriented programming (OOP) works in Processing,
  let's embark on a short conceptual discussion of "objects"
  themselves. Imagine you were not programming in Processing, but
  were instead writing out a program for your day, a list of
  instructions, if you will. It might start out something like:

  <ul>
    <li>Wake up.</li>

    <li>Drink coffee (or tea).</li>

    <li>Eat breakfast: cereal, blueberries, and soy milk.</li>

    <li>Ride the subway.</li>
  </ul>What is involved here? Specifically, what things are
  involved? First, although it may not be immediately apparent from
  how we wrote the above instructions, the main thing is you , a
  human being, a person. You exhibit certain properties. You look a
  certain way; perhaps you have brown hair, wear glasses, and
  appear slightly nerdy. You also have the ability to do stuff ,
  such as wake up (presumably you can also sleep), eat, or ride the
  subway. An object is just like you, a thing that has properties
  and can do stuff.<br>
  <br>
  So how does this relate to programming? The properties of an
  object are variables; and the things an object can do are
  functions. Object-oriented programming is the marriage of all of
  the programming fundamentals: data and functionality.<br>
  <br>
  Let's map out the data and functions for a very simple human
  object:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Human data</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Height.</li>

    <li>Weight.</li>

    <li>Gender.</li>

    <li>Eye color.</li>

    <li>Hair color.</li>
  </ul><strong>Human functions</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Sleep.</li>

    <li>Wake up.</li>

    <li>Eat.</li>

    <li>Ride some form of transportation.</li>
  </ul>Now, before we get too much further, we need to embark on a
  brief metaphysical digression. The above structure is not a human
  being itself; it simply describes the idea, or the concept,
  behind a human being. It describes what it is to be human. To be
  human is to have height, hair, to sleep, to eat, and so on. This
  is a crucial distinction for programming objects. This human
  being template is known as a <em>class</em>. A <em>class</em>is
  different from an <em>object</em>. You are an object. I am an
  object. That guy on the subway is an object. Albert Einstein is
  an object. We are all people, real world <em>instances</em>of the
  idea of a human being.<br>
  <br>
  Think of a cookie cutter. A cookie cutter makes cookies, but it
  is not a cookie itself. The cookie cutter is the <em>class</em>,
  the cookies are the <em>objects</em>.

  <h3>Using an Object</h3>Before we look at the actual writing of a
  class itself, let's briefly look at how using objects in our main
  program (i.e., <strong>setup()</strong>and
  <strong>draw()</strong>) makes the world a better place.<br>
  <br>
  Consider the pseudo-code for a simple sketch that moves a
  rectangle horizontally across the window (we'll think of this
  rectangle as a "car").<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Data (Global Variables)</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>Car color.</li>

    <li>Car x location.</li>

    <li>Car y location.</li>

    <li>Car x speed.</li>
  </ul><strong>Setup</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>Initialize car color.</li>

    <li>Initialize car location to starting point.</li>

    <li>Initialize car speed.</li>
  </ul><strong>Draw</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>Fill background.</li>

    <li>Display car at location with color.</li>

    <li>Increment car's location by speed.</li>
  </ul>To implement the above pseudo-code, we would define global
  variables at the top of the program, initialized them in setup(),
  and call functions to move and display the car in draw().
  Something like:
  <pre>
c = color(0)
x = 0.0
y = 100.0
speed = 1.0

def setup():
  size(200, 200)

def draw():
  background(255)
  move()
  display()

def move():
  global x
  x = x + speed
  if x &gt; width:
          x = 0

def display():
  fill(c)
  rect(x, y, 30, 10)
</pre><br>
  Object-oriented programming allows us to take all of the
  variables and functions out of the main program and store them
  inside a car object. A car object will know about its data -
  <em>color</em>, <em>location</em>, <em>speed</em>. The object
  will also know about the <em>stuff it can do</em>, the methods
  (functions inside an object) - the car can <em>drive</em>and it
  can be <em>displayed</em>.<br>
  <br>
  Using object-oriented design, the pseudocode improves to look
  something like this:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Data (Global Variables)</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>Car object.</li>
  </ul><strong>Setup</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>Initialize car object.</li>
  </ul><strong>Draw</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>Fill background.</li>

    <li>Display car object.</li>

    <li>Drive car object.</li>
  </ul>Notice we removed all of the global variables from the first
  example. Instead of having separate variables for car color, car
  location, and car speed, we now have only one variable, a Car
  variable! And instead of initializing those three variables, we
  initialize one thing, the Car object. Where did those variables
  go? They still exist, only now they live inside of the Car object
  (and will be defined in the Car class, which we will get to in a
  moment).<br>
  <br>
  Moving beyond pseudocode, the actual body of the sketch might
  look like:
  <pre>
myCar = Car()

def draw():
  background(255)
  myCar.drive()
  myCar.display()
</pre><br>
  We are going to get into the details regarding the above code in
  a moment, but before we do so, let's take a look at how the Car
  class itself is written.

  <h3>Writing the Cookie Cutter</h3>The simple Car example above
  demonstrates how the use of objects in Processing makes for
  clean, readable code. The hard work goes into writing the object
  template, that is the class itself. When you are first learning
  about object-oriented programming, it is often a useful exercise
  to take a program written without objects and, not changing the
  functionality at all, rewrite it using objects. We will do
  exactly this with the car example, recreating exactly the same
  look and behavior in an object-oriented manner.<br>
  <br>
  All classes must include four elements: name, data
  initialization, and methods. (Technically, the only actual
  required element is the class name, but the point of doing
  object-oriented programming is to include all of these.)<br>
  <br>
  Here is how we can take the elements from a simple
  non-object-oriented sketch and place them into a Car class, from
  which we will then be able to make Car objects.<br>
  <br>

  <table width="656">
    <tr>
      <td></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="obj_pre">

    self.xpos = 0

      <td>&rarr;</td>

      <td class="obj_desc">Functionality</td>
    </tr>
  </table><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Class Name</strong>: The name is specified by <tt>class
  WhateverNameYouChoose(object)</tt>. We then enclose all of the
  code for the class in an indented block. Class names are
  traditionally capitalized (to distinguish them from variable
  names, which traditionally are lowercase).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Data initialization</strong>: Python will automatically
  call a method named <tt>__init__</tt> whenever you create an
  object from a class. You should define this method in your class
  and initialize its data here. When you're writing code inside of
  a method, there's a special word <tt>self</tt> that allows you to
  set variables that are defined on each individual instance of a
  class. Variables defined this way are often referred to as
  "instance variables." (The <tt>__init__</tt> method is analogous
  to "constructors" in other object-oriented languages, like Java
  and C++.)<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Functionality</strong>: We can add functionality to our
  object by writing methods. The first parameter of every method
  (including <tt>__init__</tt>) should be <tt>self</tt>. Python
  automatically passes this parameter to the method when you call
  it; it's what allows you to access each object's instance
  variables inside of the method.<br>
  <br>
  Note that the code for a class exists as its own block and can be
  placed anywhere outside of <strong>setup()</strong> and
  <strong>draw()</strong>, as long as it's defined before you use
  it.

  <h3>Using an Object: The Details</h3>Earlier, we took a quick
  peek at how an object can greatly simplify the main parts of a
  Processing sketch (i.e. <strong>setup()</strong> and
  <strong>draw()</strong>).
  <pre>
<strong># Step 1. Instantiate the object.</strong>
myCar = Car()

def setup():
  size(200, 200)

def draw():
  background(255)
  <strong># Step 2. Call methods on the object.</strong> 
  myCar.drive()   
  myCar.display()
</pre>Let's look at the details behind the above steps outlining
how to use an object in your sketch.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step 1. Instantiating an object variable.</strong><br>
  <br>
  In order to initialize a variable (i.e., give it a starting
  value), we use an assignment operation - variable equals
  something. With other Python data types, it looks like this:
  <pre>
# Variable Initialization   
var = 10   # var equals 10     
</pre><br>
  Initializing an object is a bit more complex. Instead of simply
  assigning it a value, like with an integer or floating point
  number, we have to <i>instantiate</i> the object. We do this by
  calling the name of the class as though it were a function.
  <pre>
# Object instantiation
myCar = Car()
</pre><br>
  In the above example, "myCar" is the object variable name and "="
  indicates we are setting it equal to something, that something
  being a new instance of a Car object. What we are really doing
  here is initializing a Car object. When you initialize a
  primitive variable, such as an integer, you just set it equal to
  a number. But an object may contain multiple pieces of data.
  Recalling the Car class, we see that this line of code calls the
  <em>__init__ method</em>, a special method that initializes all
  of the object's variables and makes sure the Car object is ready
  to go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step 2. Using an object</strong><br>
  <br>
  Once we have successfully instantiated an object, we can use it.
  Using an object involves calling methods that are built into that
  object. A human object can eat, a car can drive, a dog can bark.
  Calling a function inside of an object is accomplished via dot
  syntax: variableName.objectFunction(Function Arguments)<br>
  <br>
  In the case of the car, none of the available functions has an
  argument so it looks like:
  <pre>
# Functions are called with the "dot syntax". 
myCar.drive()
myCar.display()
</pre>

  <h3>Arguments to the __init__ method</h3>In the above examples,
  the car object was initialized like so:
  <pre>
myCar = Car()
</pre><br>
  This was a useful simplification while we learned the basics of
  OOP. Nonetheless, there is a rather serious problem with the
  above code. What if we wanted to write a program with two car
  objects?
  <pre>
# Creating two car objects    
myCar1 = Car()
myCar2 = Car()
</pre><br>
  This accomplishes our goal; the code will produce two car
  objects, one stored in the variable myCar1 and one in myCar2.
  However, if you study the Car class, you will notice that these
  two cars will be identical: each one will be colored white, start
  in the middle of the screen, and have a speed of 1. In English,
  the above reads:<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Make a new car.</em></strong><br>
  <br>
  We want to instead say:<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Make a new red car, at location (0,10) with a speed
  of 1.</em></strong><br>
  <br>
  So that we could also say:<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Make a new blue car, at location (0,100) with a speed
  of 2.</em></strong><br>
  <br>
  We can do this by placing arguments inside of the parentheses:
  <pre>
myCar = Car(color(255,0,0), 0, 100, 2)
</pre><br>
  The <tt>__init__</tt> method must be rewritten to incorporate
  these arguments:
  <pre>
def __init__(self, c, xpos, ypos, xspeed):
  self.c = c   
  self.xpos = xpos
  self.ypos = ypos
  self.xspeed = xspeed
</pre><br>
  In my experience, the use of <tt>__init__</tt> method arguments
  to initialize object variables can be somewhat bewildering.
  Please do not blame yourself. The code is strange-looking and can
  seem awfully redundant: "For every single variable I want, I have
  to add an argument to the <tt>__init__</tt> method?"<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, this is quite an important skill to learn, and,
  ultimately, is one of the things that makes object-oriented
  programming powerful. But for now, it may feel painful. Let's
  looks at how parameter works in this context.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/init_arguments.png"><br>
  <br>
  Parameters are local variables used inside the body of a function
  that get filled with values when the function is called. In the
  examples, they have <em>one purpose only</em>, which is to
  initialize the variables inside of an object. These are the
  variables that count, the car's actual color, the car's actual
  <em>x</em> location, and so on. The <tt>__init__</tt> methods
  arguments are just <em>temporary</em>, and exist solely to pass a
  value from where the object is made into the object itself. You
  can name these function parameters whatever you want, of
  course&mdash;they don't have to have the same names as the
  instance variables. However, it is advisable to choose a name
  that makes sense to you, and also to stay consistent.<br>
  <br>
  We can now take a look at the same sketch with multiple object
  instances, each with unique properties.
  <pre>
# Even though there are multiple objects, we still only need one class. 
# No matter how many cookies we make, only one cookie cutter is needed.
class Car(object):
# The Constructor is defined with arguments.
def __init__(self, c, xpos, ypos, xspeed):
    self.c = c
    self.xpos = xpos
    self.ypos = ypos
    self.xspeed = xspeed

def display(self):
    stroke(0)
    fill(self.c)
    rectMode(CENTER)
    rect(self.xpos, self.ypos, 20, 10);

def drive(self):
    self.xpos = self.xpos + self.xspeed;
    if self.xpos > width:
        self.xpos = 0

myCar1 = Car(color(255, 0, 0), 0, 100, 2)
myCar2 = Car(color(0, 255, 255), 0, 10, 1)

def setup():
    size(200,200)

def draw(): 
    background(255)
    myCar1.drive()
    myCar1.display()
    myCar2.drive()
    myCar2.display()

</pre>

  <h3>Objects are data types too!</h3>Assuming this is your first
  experience with object-oriented programming, it's important to
  take it easy. The examples here just one class and make, at most,
  two or three objects from that class. Nevertheless, there are no
  actual limitations. A Processing sketch can include as many
  classes as you feel like writing.<br>
  <br>
  If you were programming the Space Invaders game, for example, you
  might create a <em>Spaceship</em> class, an <em>Enemy</em> class,
  and a <em>Bullet</em> class, using an object for each entity in
  your game.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, although not primitive, classes are data types just
  like integers and floats. And since classes are made up of data,
  an object can therefore contain other objects! For example, let's
  assume you had just finished programming a <em>Fork</em> and
  <em>Spoon</em> class. Moving on to a <em>PlaceSetting</em> class,
  you would likely include variables for both a <em>Fork</em>
  object and a <em>Spoon</em> object inside that class itself. This
  is perfectly reasonable and quite common in object-oriented
  programming.
  <pre>
class PlaceSetting(object):
  def __init__(self):
    fork = Fork()
    spoon = Spoon()
</pre><br>
  Objects, just like any data type, can also be passed in as
  arguments to a function. In the Space Invaders game example, if
  the spaceship shoots the bullet at the enemy, we would probably
  want to write a function inside the Enemy class to determine if
  the Enemy had been hit by the bullet.
  <pre>
def hit(self, bullet):
  bulletX = bullet.getX()
  bulletY = bullet.getY()
  # Code to determine if   
  # the bullet struck the enemy   
</pre>
