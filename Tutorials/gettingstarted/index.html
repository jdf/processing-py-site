        <p>Welcome to Python Mode for Processing!</p>

        <p>Start by visiting <a href=
        "http://processing.org/download">http://processing.org/download</a>
        and selecting the Mac, Windows, or Linux version, depending
        on what machine you have. Installation on each machine is
        straightforward:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>On Windows, you'll have a .zip file. Double-click it,
          and drag the folder inside to a location on your hard
          disk. It could be Program Files or simply the desktop,
          but the important thing is for the processing folder to
          be pulled out of that .zip file. Then double-click
          processing.exe to start.</li>

          <li>The Mac OS X version is also a .zip file.
          Double-click it and drag the Processing icon to the
          Applications folder. If you're using someone else's
          machine and can't modify the Applications folder, just
          drag the application to the desktop. Then double-click
          the Processing icon to start.</li>

          <li>The Linux version is a .tar.gz file, which should be
          familiar to most Linux users. Download the file to your
          home directory, then open a terminal window, and
          type:<br>
          <tt>tar xvfz processing-xxxx.tgz</tt><br>
          (Replace xxxx with the rest of the file's name, which is
          the version number.) This will create a folder named
          processing-2.0 or something similar. Then change to that
          directory:<br>
          <tt>cd processing-xxxx</tt><br>
          and run it:<br>
          <tt>./processing</tt></li>
        </ul>

        <p>With any luck, the main Processing window will now be
        visible. Everyone's setup is different, so if the program
        didn't start, or you're otherwise stuck, visit the <a href=
        "http://wiki.processing.org/w/Troubleshooting">troubleshooting
        page</a> for possible solutions.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Python Mode</h3>

        <p>Processing doesn't include support for the Python
        programming language by default. In order to enable Python
        support, you'll need to install an add-on called Python
        Mode. You can do this by clicking on the drop-down menu on
        the right side of the tool bar and selecting "Add Mode..."
        A window with the title "Mode Manager" will appear. Scroll
        down until you see "Python" and press "Install." <a href=
        "https://github.com/jdf/processing.py#python-mode-for-processing">
        More information here</a>.</p>

        <p>After you've installed Python Mode, you can switch back
        and forth between the Python and Java versions of
        Processing using the drop-down menu in the tool bar. If you
        find yourself getting strange syntax errors or exceptions
        when running your program, make sure you have the right
        mode selected!</p>

        <h3>Your First Program</h3>

        <p>You're now running the Processing Development
        Environment (or PDE), with Python Mode installed. There's
        not much to it; the large area is the Text Editor, and
        there's a row of buttons across the top; this is the
        toolbar. Below the editor is the Message Area, and below
        that is the Console. The Message Area is used for one line
        messages, and the Console is used for more technical
        details.</p>

        <p>In the editor, type the following:</p>
        <pre>
<span style="color: #006699;">ellipse</span>(50, 50, 80, 80)

</pre>

        <p>This line of code means "draw an ellipse, with the
        center 50 pixels over from the left and 50 pixels down from
        the top, with a width and height of 80 pixels." Click the
        Run button, which looks like this:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-Play.gif" width="60" height="60"
        alt="Run"></p>

        <p>If you've typed everything correctly, you'll see this
        appear in the Display Window:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Ex_02_01.gif" width="100" height=
        "100"></p>

        <p>If you didn't type it correctly, the Message Area will
        turn red and complain about an error. If this happens, make
        sure that you've copied the example code exactly: the
        numbers should be contained within parentheses and have
        commas between each of them.</p>

        <p>One of the most difficult things about getting started
        with programming is that you have to be very specific about
        the syntax. The Processing software isn't always smart
        enough to know what you mean, and can be quite fussy about
        the placement of punctuation. You'll get used to it with a
        little practice.</p>

        <p>Next, we'll skip ahead to a sketch that's a little more
        exciting. Delete the text from the last example, and try
        this:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Ex_02_02.gif" width="480" height=
        "120"></p>
        <pre>
<span style="color: #33997E;">def</span> <span style=
"color: #006699;"><b>setup</b></span>():
    <span style="color: #006699;">size</span>(480, 120)

<span style="color: #33997E;">def</span> <span style=
"color: #006699;"><b>draw</b></span>():
    <span style="color: #669900;">if</span> <span style=
"color: #D94A7A;"> mousePressed</span>:
        <span style="color: #006699;">fill</span>(0)
    <span style="color: #669900;">else</span>:
        <span style="color: #006699;">fill</span>(255)
    <span style="color: #006699;">ellipse</span>(<span style=
"color: #D94A7A;">mouseX</span>, <span style=
"color: #D94A7A;">mouseY</span>, 80, 80)
</pre>

        <p>This program creates a window that is 480 pixels wide
        and 120 pixels high, and then starts drawing white circles
        at the position of the mouse. When a mouse button is
        pressed, the circle color changes to black. We'll explain
        more about the elements of this program in detail later.
        For now, run the code, move the mouse, and click to
        experience it.</p>

        <p>Note: Be careful about how you indent each line!
        Indentation is important in Python, and indenting
        incorrectly or inconsistently can cause your program to
        work differently from how you intended, or not work at all.
        You can use any number of spaces, as long as you're
        consistent about the number of spaces you use. (Many Python
        programmers prefer four spaces, others prefer two.) You can
        also use the tab key to indent your code, but don't use
        tabs and spaces for indentation in the same program.</p>

        <h3>Show</h3>

        <p>So far we've covered only the Run button, though you've
        probably guessed what the Stop button next to it does:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-Stop.gif" width="60" height="60"
        alt="Stop"></p>

        <p>If you don't want to use the buttons, you can always use
        the Sketch menu, which reveals the shortcut Ctrl-R (or
        Cmd-R on the Mac) for Run. Below Run in the Sketch menu is
        Present, which clears the rest of the screen to present
        your sketch all by itself:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-SketchPresent.gif" width="180"
        height="139" alt="Sketch menu"></p>

        <p>You can also use Present from the toolbar by holding
        down the Shift key as you click the Run button.</p>

        <h3>Save</h3>

        <p>The next command that's important is Save. It's the
        downward arrow on the toolbar:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-Save.gif" width="60" height="60"
        alt="Save"></p>

        <p>You can also find it under the File menu. By default,
        your programs are saved to the "sketchbook," which is a
        folder that collects your programs for easy access.
        Clicking the Open button on the toolbar (the arrow pointing
        up) will bring up a list of all the sketches in your
        sketchbook, as well as a list of examples that are
        installed with the Processing software:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-Open.gif" width="60" height="60"
        alt="Open"></p>

        <p>It's always a good idea to save your sketches often. As
        you try different things, keep saving with different names,
        so that you can always go back to an earlier version. This
        is especially helpful if &mdash; no, when &mdash; something
        breaks. You can also see where the sketch is located on the
        disk with Show Sketch Folder under the Sketch menu.</p>

        <p>You can also create a new sketch by pressing the New
        button on the toolbar:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-New.gif" width="60" height="60" alt=
        "New"></p><!-- commenting this out because Export Application is not yet supported?
        <h3>Share</h3>

        <p>Another theme of Processing is sharing your work. The Export Application button on
the toolbar:</p>

        <p><img src="imgs/Menu-Export.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="Export" /></p>


        <p>will bundle your code into an application for your choice of Mac, Windows, or Linux depending on which platform you are using.
This is an easy way to make self-contained, double-clickable versions of your projects.
        </p>

        <p>You can also find Export Application under the File menu.</p> -->

        <h3>Examples and Reference</h3>

        <p>Learning how to program with Processing and Python
        involves exploring lots of code: running, altering,
        breaking, and enhancing it until you have reshaped it into
        something new. With this in mind, the Processing software
        download includes dozens of examples that demonstrate
        different features of the software. To open an example,
        select Examples from the File menu or click the Open icon
        in the PDE. The examples are grouped into categories based
        on their function, such as Form, Motion, and Image. Find an
        interesting topic in the list and try an example.</p>
        <!-- this also appears to not exist in Python Mode
        <p>If you see a part of the program you're unfamiliar with that is colored
orange (this means it's a part of Processing), select its name, and then
click on "Find in Reference" from the Help menu. You can also right-click
the text (or Ctrl-click on a Mac) and choose Find in Reference from the
menu that appears. This will open the reference for the selected code
element in your web browser. <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/">
        The reference is also available online</a>.</p> -->

        <p>The Processing Reference explains every code element
        with a description and examples. The reference programs are
        much shorter (usually four or five lines) and easier to
        follow than the longer code found in the Examples folder.
        We recommend keeping the reference open while you're
        reading this book and while you're programming. It can be
        navigated by topic or alphabetically; sometimes it's
        fastest to do a text search within your browser window.</p>

        <p>The reference was written with the beginner in mind; we
        hope that we've made it clear and understandable. We're
        grateful to the many people who've spotted errors over the
        years and reported them. If you think you can improve a
        reference entry or you find a mistake, please let us know
        by clicking on the link at the top of each reference
        page.</p>
